# Beam Calculator

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://beam-calculator.streamlit.app/)

## Welcome! 👋

Many years ago, during my early coding adventures, I developed a concrete beam calculator to assist with structural analysis using **Python**. Today, I'm happy to present its modern reincarnation as a web application, powered by [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It could be not perfect, but was very useful for me at the beginning of my structural engineering career.

## Features 🚀

- **Load Analysis**: Uniform distribuited load
- **Support Configurations**: Analyze beams with different support conditions such as simply supported, fixed, and cantilevered.
- **Material Selection**: Choose from a range of materials, each with predefined properties.
- **Section Properties**: Define the dimensions.
- **Visualization**: Explore the results visually.
