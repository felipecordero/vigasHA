# Beam Calculator

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://beam-calculator.streamlit.app/)

## Welcome! 👋

Years ago, during my early coding adventures, I developed a beam calculator to assist with structural analysis. Today, I'm thrilled to present its modern reincarnation as a web application, powered by [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

## Features 🚀

- **Load Analysis**: Uniform distribuited load
- **Support Configurations**: Analyze beams with different support conditions such as simply supported, fixed, and cantilevered.
- **Material Selection**: Choose from a range of materials, each with predefined properties.
- **Section Properties**: Define the dimensions.
- **Visualization**: Explore the results visually.

## Getting Started 🛠️

To use the Beam Calculator:

1. Visit the [Beam Calculator App](https://beam-calculator.streamlit.app/).
2. Input the beam parameters.
3. Define the loading conditions and support configurations.
4. Click "Calculate" and Voilá.
5. View the results!
